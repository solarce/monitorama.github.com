          <h4>Join us in Boston.</h4>
          <p>We'll be hearing talks from leading open source developers and web operations luminaries, and then taking what we've learned to apply it towards advancing the state of open source monitoring and trending software.</p>

          <h4>Why me?</h4>
          <p>Because you care about the tools that you work with. You're a craftsman within your team and want to help improve the work environment for you and your peers. We've all heard that monitoring sucks, but you want to do something about it.</p>

          <h4>Boston in March?</h4>
          <p>You better believe it. The end of March is already in Spring and the weather is starting to warm up. Bring a light jacket and prepare to kick ass.</p>

          <h4>I'm convinced. What now?</h4>
          <p>Grab your ticket as soon as soon as registration opens. Be forewarned, space is limited and interest is surging.</p>

          <h4>Not Your Average Single-Track.</h4>
          <p>Monitorama takes place March 28-29, 2013 in Boston's NERD Center. Rise and shine for single-track sessions in the morning that will enlighten and inspire you for the afternoon activities. After lunch we'll break out into workshops to level up your craftsman tools (e.g. Logstash filters, D3.js, etc), or jump right into the hackathon and pair up with a friend or hack on your own.
